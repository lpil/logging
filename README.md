```sh
gleam add logging
```

```gleam
import logging.{Info}

pub fn main() {
  // Run this once at the start of your program
  logging.configure()

  // And get logging!
  logging.log(Info, "Hello, Joe!")
}
```

## Disabling the colored output

When using some logger services, colored output can be superfluous, because
they're not processed at all, and appears as real characters. You can set
the `NO_COLOR` to any string that _is not_ `"false"` or the empty string in your
environment to disable the colored output from the logger.

Further documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/logging>.
